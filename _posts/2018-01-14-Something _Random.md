## Too much love!
Sometimes I think I'm too much in my original version and doing anything too much leads to unpleasant effects.
Also in the case of love, let's talk about it.

Have you ever thought what if your love is not reciprocated? You get hurt to a great extent and even if your love is reciprocated, you feel it less.
You fail to recognize things other person does for you!
That's not weird because when you love too much, you are into the same energy that expects thing coming in same energy. Anything other than that is less and hurting to you. If you love too much make sure you expect very less. Don't even think he/she is gonna stay with you.
At the end if he/she stays, you got a reason to smile if not then I already told you not to think he/she is yours.

Life isn't simple, it not goes on as you expect it to go. It makes you face many odds and evens. You will face many kind of rejections or heartbreaks and you might think that you will take revenge and that's where you go wrong. You can never heal yourself by breaking someone else.
May be that's why someone said that by taking revenge you dig graves for two, one for you.

I think love is simple, love is to always stand together through everything, no matter what! Love never damage you, you never damage your love.
It's about finding completeness in your incompleteness and finding a way to keep you better half smiling ðŸ˜Š

At the end I'll say keep loving as much as you can but expect as less as you can that's the key to happiness in a relationship.
