## This is how I spent my life at Kota....
This one is gonna be long. Sorry!

Here I go!

My parents, unlike me believed that if I will prepare for JEE from Kota, I will secure more marks. I told them that I donâ€™t want to go Kota for preparation but my dad told me that I can do better if I get good coaching and in Kota I will meet many experienced teachers which will guide me in a better way.

Everything was good but I had no idea how to convince my dad that I donâ€™t want to leave her here and go Kota. My silence was enough for my dad to book tickets for Kota and everything was planned against my wish and I was still thinking how would I say my love that I have to go as I have no other option left.

That Evening I called her..

I told her about the situation and she happily tried to convince me that this decision is for betterment of my future and I have to concentrate on my studies more as Iâ€™m in a critical situation right now and this will decide rest of my life. (I need not mention how much important JEE is for Indians).

I was leaving for Kota on Thrusday and we decided to meet one last time before leaving.

And finally we met ðŸ˜Š

We tried our best not to break in tears and behaved as if nothing happened. We went for a walk as usual. We had a great time together and when it was time to go back she handed me a piece of paper and told me to open it later and I happily agreed.

### First Day at Kota:

I took admission in Vibrant Academy and I was alloted Y4* batch. My classes were starting from next week.

My Parents decided to stay 2 days in Kota with me and then leave me in a good Hostel. The food quality of the mess was horrible and Kota was also famous for Swine Flu at that time. My mother knew my tantrums in eating food and carelessness so she decided to stay in Kota with me.

Now instead of looking for a hostel we took a flat on rent. I had an Android Smartphone with me at that time and at the syllabus at the starting was easy so somehow I managed coaching + chatting time easily. I secured 7th Rank in the Vibrant Academy in the First Test. After one or two weeks the syllabus became tough and it became tough for me to concentrate on my studies as I was engaged in chatting most of the time. My mother was with me and can clearly figure out that I was wasting my time.

One fine day my mother asked me that can I leave this smartphone and internet thing at least for a year. I was speechless. I wasnâ€™t taking studies seriously that time. I thought that I manage all the things efficiently but my marks and rank jumped exponentially in next test. If Iâ€™m not wrong my rank in tests were 30th, 110th, 507th. I realized that for achieving something I have to sacrifice just like my parents have sacrificed. My mother was staying with me just to ensure I stay healthy and take proper diet and here Iâ€™m wasting my time in chatting. I realized that if she is really worth that time then I can give her time after this era (Yeah, I consider that Kota Stage as an era). I told her that I wonâ€™t chat with her anymore and concentrate on my studies as that is more important at present. I believed that she will understand my situation and support me like always, and she didnâ€™t disappoint me.

I concentrated on my studies at Kota after this incident which took first 3 weeks. I met few amazing friends, Gaurav Jaiswal is one of them and Iâ€™m still thankful to get IITians like him in my friend list. We had a great time there at Kota. Faculties at Kota have an unmatched style of teaching. Every Faculty is just awesome in their fields. I consider myself very lucky to get a chance to study at Kota and I believe that even if a student isnâ€™t preparing for JEE he/she should study at Kota once.

I donâ€™t know where my anger towards Kota changed into love and today I wish I could relive my Kota life with my friends again.

In the last month I managed to get a Nokia 1600 and used to talk with her, keeping in mind that I donâ€™t waste any single minute of my studies. Coaching was around 10 minutes walking distance from my flat. So I used to walk and that 10 minutes of the morning used to power me for the whole day! She always requested me to choose a college in the same city where she was going. I promised her that I wonâ€™t disappoint her and our sacrifice wonâ€™t go in vain.

I came to know she got college in Delhi. She insisted me to please make sure we remain in the same city.

Phew!â€¦â€¦.

Finally, everything was on track and I did my best.

JEE 2016 witnessed my performance and I managed to secure a good rank in Advanced but I was determined to choose CSE as branch and got college accordingly.

Did I mention I got CSE at NIT Delhi?

But life had other plans ðŸ˜…

P.S: She broke up with me in our first Delhi meetup.

<dt>Meanwhile I just opened the paper which she instructed me to open later.</dt>

Rang the, noor tha, Jab kareeb tu tha
Ek jannat sa tha, yeh jahaan
Waqt ki ret pe kuch mere naam sa
Likh ke chhod gaya tu kahaan.
