## A Cute Mistake!

This incident is not alive in my memory,but it's immortal in my parent's memory.
According to them, I was around 4 years old at that time. My father was busy watching news and my mother informed there is no sugar left at home. She asked my father to bring sugar from the market but he didn't want to leave his news so he said my elder brother to bring sugar. I insisted my father to allow me to bring sugar from the market but instead of allowing me he kissed me and said nothing (Ninja Technique of saying NO!). My brother went to market and meanwhile I was on the gate, waiting for him to bring sugar. As soon as he arrived, I snatched sugar from his hands and rushed towards Kitchen. As I passed the bedroom, my dad saw me carrying sugar and he asked me how much sugar did I buy. I stopped there (behind the kitchen's wall) and I poured all the sugar on the ground and started counting it. My dad asked me the same question again, but this time I was busy counting the sugar crystals one by one. When I didn't answer dad's question he came out of the room to check where I'm busy and when he found me counting the sugar crystals he smiled. When I realised he was standing behind me since last 10 seconds, I turned towards him and said "One minute Papa, it's almost done!". 
Just like you they also burst into laughter.

Sigh!
I wonder how smart a kid can be!
