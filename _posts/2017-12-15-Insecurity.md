## Insecurity


Suppose you got a stone in your garden. You like the shining and colour of the stone so you picked that stone from there and placed it on your study table. 
One day you came to know that the stone isnâ€™t a ordinary stone. Itâ€™s an Emerald. What will you do? 
Youâ€™ll suddenly remove the stone from your study table and place that valuable stone safely in your almirah so that nobody else can see it and take it from you. Note this.
Now realize what you did here!!

As soon as you realize that the stone is precious, you became insecure about it. The thought that someone might steal that from you started popping in your mind. Thatâ€™s why you hid the stone from everyone. Isnâ€™t it?

Youâ€™re insecure ðŸ˜Š Ever wondered why? No? Okâ€¦ Lemme narrate you another aspect of the story.

Imagine the same story with Ambani in place of your character. Will he hide the stone? 
Nope, because he isnâ€™t insecure about that stone. 
Now coming back to the question Youâ€™re insecure, Ever wondered why?
Because you know that you arenâ€™t capable enough to own that. You know you donâ€™t deserve that and someone can snatch that from you because youâ€™re weak.
So if you think that the thing is for you, you wonâ€™t feel insecure :) because you know you deserve that and no one on this earth can snatch your things from you. 

Stay Strong, Stay Happy <3
