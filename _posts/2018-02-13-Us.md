## Us
We hold on longer than we should.  
That's the thing with people like us.  
Smile more, even when we know we can't.  
See the glass half empty, rather than half full.  
Kill ourselves from inside, but stand in front of others, hiding our scars.  
Act strong, because it helps.  
Hide the answers to their questions, not realising how much our eyes speak.  
................  
You and me,  
We're the same!  
It's just that,  
You can't stay,  
and I can't leave.  
And that's how our story is ðŸ˜Š
